# caldwellz.github.io

This is the source code for the Gatsby-based iteration of my software development portfolio. For the original version (pure HTML/CSS/JS), see the ["classic" subfolder](https://github.com/caldwellz/caldwellz.github.io/tree/classic).

##  Development Quick Start

To run the site in developer mode:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/caldwellz/caldwellz.github.io
cd caldwellz.github.io
npm install
npm run develop
```

The site should now be available at http://localhost:8000.
