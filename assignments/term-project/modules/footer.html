    // Since modules are loaded async and general functions are guaranteed
    // to already be present, I think this is actually the cleanest solution
    // vs having an event listener specifically for this, or an external script
    // with a single function call. Just putting in an onload would have been
    // preferable but naturally it doesn't seem to work when loaded this way...
    // Also, it's in the footer so it works on footer links too, just for fun.
